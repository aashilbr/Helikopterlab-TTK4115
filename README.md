# Helikopterlab-TTK4115 - Linear system theory

Helicopterlab in the course TTK4115 - Linear system theory. 
The project had four parts: 
*  **Monovariable control** 
*  **Multivariable control** 
*  **Luenberger observer**
*  **Kalman filter**

We used Matlab and Simulink for implementation, experimentation and tuning.
